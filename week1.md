### Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

- Nanotechnology involves studying very small objects that **cannot be fully explained by classical mechanics**[1].
- Quantum mechanics is required for understanding behavior at atomic and subatomic scales.

### Classical vs. Quantum Descriptions

- **Classical particles:** Properties include mass ($$ m $$), charge ($$ q $$), position ($$ r(t) $$), and velocity ($$ v(t) $$). Their motion follows Newton’s laws, and all observables can be predicted with certainty if initial conditions are known.
- **Physical observables** (like energy) vary continuously in classical mechanics.

### Classical Wave Phenomena

- **Examples:** Ocean waves, sound, electromagnetic (light) waves.
- **Wave properties:** Amplitude, velocity, frequency ($$ f $$), wavelength ($$ \lambda $$).
- **Wave equation:** Solutions can be written as $$ x(t) = A \exp(i(kx - \omega t)) + B \exp(i(kx + \omega t)) $$.
- **Phase velocity ($$ v_p $$)** vs. **group velocity ($$ v_g $$)**: Group velocity is the speed that the "envelope" of a wave packet moves.
- **Dispersive medium:** Phase velocity depends on frequency; different frequencies travel at different speeds.

### Key Wave Concepts for Exam

- **Interference:** Constructive (amplitudes add), destructive (cancel out).
- **Diffraction:** Occurs when waves pass through openings or around corners, stronger for smaller openings.
- **Young’s Double Slit experiment:** Demonstrates interference and supports wave theory of light.

### Why Quantum Mechanics?

- Classical physics fails at microscopic scales (atoms, electrons).
- Experiments such as the **photoelectric effect** could not be explained classically.

### Photoelectric Effect

- **Setup:** Light hits a metal, causing electron emission.
- **Key findings:** At low frequencies, no electrons are emitted regardless of intensity; at high enough frequencies, electrons are emitted even with low intensity.
- **Einstein’s Explanation:** Light consists of particles (photons) with energy $$ E = hf $$ (Planck’s constant $$ h $$, frequency $$ f $$).
- **Maximum kinetic energy of emitted electrons:** $$ KE_{\text{max}} = hf - \phi $$, where $$ \phi $$ is the work function.

### Atomic Models

- **Rutherford Model:** Electron orbits nucleus, but predicts instability (electron should spiral into nucleus).
- **Bohr Model:** Electrons only occupy specific orbits where angular momentum is quantized ($$ mvr = n\frac{h}{2\pi} $$), and energy is quantized ($$ E_n = -13.6\,\text{eV}/n^2 $$ for hydrogen).

### Important Bohr Model Equations

- **Radius of nth orbit:** $$ r_n = n^2 a_0 $$, with $$ a_0 = 0.53 $$ Å (Bohr radius).
- **Energy difference (spectral lines):** 
  $$
  E = h f = E_{n_i} - E_{n_f} = 13.6\,\text{eV} \left(\frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2}\right)
  $$
- **Rydberg formula for spectral lines:**
  $$
  \frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right)
  $$
  with $$ R = 1.097 \times 10^7\,\text{m}^{-1} $$

### Matter Waves and De Broglie Hypothesis

- **Wave-particle duality:** Light and matter both show particle and wave properties.
- **De Broglie wavelength for matter:** $$ \lambda = \frac{h}{p} $$ (momentum $$ p $$).
- Electrons can show interference patterns like light, confirming their wave nature (as seen in electron double-slit experiments).

#### Key Points for Revision

- **Differences between classical and quantum concepts**—know examples and why classical physics failed.
- **Definitions:** Planck’s constant ($$ h $$), work function ($$ \phi $$), photoelectric threshold frequency.
- **Bohr Model:** Quantization of energy, angular momentum, equations for orbits and energy levels.
- **De Broglie relation** for matter waves and experimental confirmation.
- **Be able to explain key experiments:** Photoelectric effect, double-slit experiment, how these drove development of quantum mechanics.
