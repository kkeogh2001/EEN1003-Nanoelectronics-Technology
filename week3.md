### Crystal Geometry: Positions, Directions, and Planes

- **Position of atoms:** Specified relative to unit cell corners using lattice vectors.
- **Miller Indices (hkl):** Used to label planes in crystals.
  - Find where the plane intercepts axes (x, y, z), take reciprocals, reduce to smallest integers—these give the (h k l).
  - Negative indices indicated with a bar (e.g., $$\overline{1}00$$).
  - Planes with the same indices but different signs (e.g., (1 2 0) and ($$\overline{1}$$ 2 0)) are equivalent.
- **Interplanar distance $$ d_{hkl} $$ in cubic crystals:**
  $$
  d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}
  $$
  where $$ a $$ is the lattice constant.
- **Directions:** Given as [u v w], related to Miller indices, specify directions in the lattice.

### Major Semiconductor Crystal Structures

- **Diamond structure:** (e.g., Si, Ge, diamond)
  - FCC lattice with a two-atom basis; atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated.
- **Zincblende structure:** (e.g., GaAs, CdTe)
  - Similar to diamond but with different atoms at each basis position.
  - Lacks inversion symmetry (non-centrosymmetric).
- **Wurtzite structure:** (e.g., CdSe)
  - Hexagonal close-packed (HCP) type.

### Atomic Packing and Nanoparticles

- **FCC nanoparticles:** Smallest consists of a cluster of 13 atoms in a polyhedral (dekatessarahedron) arrangement, relevant for nanoengineering.
- **Magic numbers:** Number of atoms in stable nanoparticle clusters: 13, 55, 147, 309, etc.

### Crystal Defects

**Point Defects**
- *Vacancy*: Missing atom creates unsatisfied bonds (dangling bonds), distorts lattice.
- *Interstitial*: Atom sits between regular lattice positions.
- *Substitutional impurities*: Foreign atom replaces host atom, changes electrical properties (dopants in semiconductors).

**Line Defects**
- *Edge dislocation*: Extra plane of atoms inserted; causes local distortion and can affect electron mobility.
- *Screw dislocation*: Planes spiral around a linear defect.
- Both types characterized by Burgers vector.

**Plane Defects**
- *Grain boundaries*: Interfaces between small crystals (grains) in polycrystalline materials.
- *Twinning*: Symmetrical mirror image division within a crystal.

### Reciprocal Lattice

- Mathematical construct to describe periodicity, important for understanding X-ray diffraction and electronic band structure.
- Each family of real crystal planes links to a vector in reciprocal space; length of vector inversely proportional to plane spacing.

### Excitons (Electron-Hole Pairs)

- **Exciton:** Bound state of an electron and a hole (analogy: positronium in atoms).
- *Mott-Wannier exciton*: Weakly bound, spreads over many lattice sites; dominant in most semiconductors (e.g., GaAs).
- *Frenkel exciton*: Strongly bound, localized; important in molecular crystals.
- **Binding energy of exciton (for GaAs, example values):**
  - $$ E_0 \sim 4.6 $$ meV, effective radius $$\sim 12$$ nm.
- **Rydberg formula** is adapted for excitons, replacing the electron mass and dielectric constant.
